--- This module provides an implementation of a First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
--- queue based on Okasaki's "Purely Functional Data Structures." Ch.3.
---
--- This Okasaki Queue version data structure ensures worst-case constant-time
--- performance for basic operations such as push, pop, and front.
---
--- The OkasakiQueue consists of two lists (front and back) to separate
--- the concerns of adding and removing elements for ensuring efficient
--- performance.

--- 𝒪(n). Adds a list of elements to the end of the ;Queue;.

--- toList: O(n). Returns a ;List; of the elements in the ;Queue;.
--- The elements are in the same order as they appear in the ;Queue;
--- (i.e. the first element of the ;Queue; is the first element of the ;List;).
